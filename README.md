## Hello there 👋

I'm Hesham Yasser, a high school student (2025) from Egypt. I have had a passion for programming and coding since I was young, and this passion has continued to grow. I really enjoy creating and developing anything related to tech. For now, I am focusing on improving my skills and gaining more experience in cybersecurity. Feel free to contact me through my social media links.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Hesham's Calculator program.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cybersecurity.
- 🌟 I recently built a program to manage passwords safely with using strong encryption to protect user passwords, check it out [here](https://github.com/Hesham0001/h-vault/)
