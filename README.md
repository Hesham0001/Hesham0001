## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hesham Yasser, a high school student (2025) from Egypt. I have had a passion for programming and coding since I was young, and this passion has continued to grow. I really enjoy creating and developing anything related to tech. For now, I am focusing on improving my skills and gaining more experience in cybersecurity. Feel free to contact me through my social media links.
